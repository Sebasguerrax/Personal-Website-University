      <h2>Electronics and Soldering</h2>
      <p>During my A-levels, I developed a keen interest in electronics, particularly through a quick course I took. Learning to solder opened up a whole new world for me, allowing me to repair and tinker with electronic devices.</p>
      <p>I have repaired a couple of my broken Xbox 360 controllers, I have also opened up my Xbox 360 to repair the disc drive and clean up, doing so made me more interested on electronics and ever since I experiment with projects at home.</p>
      <p>This interest in electronic has brought me to have a better understanding on computer parts and has throughly helped me throughout my university experience and I hope it will be of use for my future.</p>
